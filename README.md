## Overview
The **NIRMATA Framework** is the foundation of the **TRUST-IN Bharat** programme — *Trusted Resilience & Unified Security Transformation for India*.  
It provides a structured, measurable approach to assess and improve cybersecurity, data-protection, and privacy maturity across Indian enterprises of all sizes.

The framework aligns with:
- **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023)**
- **CERT-In Guidelines (2022)**
- **ISO 27001 / 27701 / 42001**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0**

It defines **six maturity levels (0–5)** and **twelve security and privacy domains**, forming a unified national reference for risk and resilience measurement.
